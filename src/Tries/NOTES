Tries Vs HashMaps

COMPLEXITY for adding,searching,deleting in HashMaps
Adding -> O(word length)
Searching -> O(word length)
Deleting -> O(word Lenght)

COMPLEXITY for adding,searching,deleting in Trie
Adding-> O(word length)
because we go deep down till the word ends
Searching-> O(word length)
Deleting -> O(word length)

even though TC is same, but practically Tries performs better beacuse we dont have to find hashcode

But SPACE wise.. Tries>>>>HashMaps
suppose.. we have words starting with A are 10000... we would only have one A.. and rest will be connected to it

but in case of hashmaps.. there will be different
