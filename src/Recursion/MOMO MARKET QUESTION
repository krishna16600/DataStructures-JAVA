 QUESTION
  
 Shreya loves to eat momos. Her mother gives her money to buy vegetables
but she manages to save some money out of it daily. After buying vegetables,
she goes to "Momos Market", where there are ‘n’ number of shops of momos. 
Each of the shop of momos has a rate per momo. She visits the market and starts
buying momos (one from each shop) starting from the first shop. She will visit the
market for ‘q’ days. You have to tell that how many momos she can buy at each day 
if she starts buying from the first shop daily. She cannot use the remaining money of 
one day on some other day. But she will save them for other expenses in future, so, 
you also need to tell the sum of money left with her at the end of each day.
